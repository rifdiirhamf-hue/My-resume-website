        <h2>Profile Summary</h2>
        <p>I am a passionate individual with a strong interest in game development, particularly in scripting and creating gameplay logic. I enjoy learning new techniques, experimenting with different systems, and improving my skills through self-practice and community knowledge.</p>
        <p>Previously, I served in the Malaysian National Army, which helped me develop strong discipline, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities under pressure.</p>
        <p>I have been creating small game projects independently, but now I am seeking an opportunity to collaborate with a team of developers. I believe that by working with more than two developers, I can further enhance my skills and contribute to building larger, more engaging, and higher-quality games.</p>
